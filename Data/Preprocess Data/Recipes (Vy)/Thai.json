It is not swimming in sauce like many Western versions found in restaurants. The dish is full of flavor with a light coating of delicious sauce in every bite. Serve with lime wedges, fish sauce, sugar, white pepper or pepper flakes, and vinegar on the table so guests can individually adjust tastes.",

But you can always substitute for either rice or noodles.\nTake out the chicken and add extra edamame and you have a great vegetarian meal instead. Or add shrimp if you like.
